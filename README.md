## Application

The "Cable Car" project was created using the Autodesk AutoCAD 2023 application. AutoCAD 2023 is a professional computer-aided design (CAD) software developed by Autodesk. It is widely used by architects, engineers, and designers to create precise 2D and 3D drawings.

## Introduction

A cable car is a type of aerial transportation system that moves passengers or cargo using cabins suspended from and propelled by cables. A cable car can operate in different configurations, including systems with one or more cables for support and movement.
Cable cars can be classified into:
- Telegondolas – Continuous-operation systems with multiple cabins, smaller in size, and often used in ski resorts.
- Aerial tramways (Telecabins) – Typically larger cabins that operate on a fixed cable, stopping at stations for boarding and departure.
- Chairlifts – Open-air seating transport, commonly used for ski resorts.

 **Usage:** Cable cars are ideal for overcoming steep slopes and providing efficient transport in mountainous regions or urban areas with difficult terrain.

## Components
There are different types of cable cars, various models, but they all have the same basic components, well-designed, and the same gripping and operating mechanism. Cable cars consist of:

- Cabin: The part that houses passengers during transport. It comes in different sizes depending on the installation requirements. It can vary from a minimum of 6 people to 8 people.
- Running assembly: It consists of rollers, brakes, and other subsystems that run on one or two carrying cables.
- Rollers: These allow the cable car to run on the carrying cables. The rollers have a locking and braking mechanism in case the hauling cable or counter-cable detaches from the roller assembly.
