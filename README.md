## Application

The "Cable Car" project was created using the Autodesk AutoCAD 2023 application. AutoCAD 2023 is a professional computer-aided design (CAD) software developed by Autodesk. It is widely used by architects, engineers, and designers to create precise 2D and 3D drawings.

## Introduction

A cable car is a type of aerial transportation system that moves passengers or cargo using cabins suspended from and propelled by cables. A cable car can operate in different configurations, including systems with one or more cables for support and movement.
Cable cars can be classified into:
- Telegondolas – Continuous-operation systems with multiple cabins, smaller in size, and often used in ski resorts.
- Aerial tramways (Telecabins) – Typically larger cabins that operate on a fixed cable, stopping at stations for boarding and departure.
- Chairlifts – Open-air seating transport, commonly used for ski resorts.

 **Usage:** Cable cars are ideal for overcoming steep slopes and providing efficient transport in mountainous regions or urban areas with difficult terrain.

## Components
There are different types of cable cars, various models, but they all have the same basic components, well-designed, and the same gripping and operating mechanism. Cable cars consist of:

- Cabin: The part that houses passengers during transport. It comes in different sizes depending on the installation requirements. It can vary from a minimum of 6 people to 8 people.
- Running assembly: It consists of rollers, brakes, and other subsystems that run on one or two carrying cables.
- Rollers: These allow the cable car to run on the carrying cables. The rollers have a locking and braking mechanism in case the hauling cable or counter-cable detaches from the roller assembly.

## Cabin 
The cable car cabin was designed with seats and space for ski equipment which provides a comfortable and functional transportation option. The cabin is equipped with seating for passengers, offering a secure and relaxed ride. 
Additionally, it includes designated areas for storing ski equipment, ensuring passengers can easily transport their skis, snowboards, and other gear.

## Station
he rolling system of the station, where cable cars take turns, is an essential component of the cable car's operation. It consists of a series of rollers and guide mechanisms that enable the cable car to transition smoothly from one section of the cable to another, especially at the station where the cable cars either slow down or change direction.

## Results
The final design of the cable car system incorporates all the essential components that ensure functionality, safety, and efficiency. The design focuses on maximizing passenger comfort while integrating technical elements such as the rolling system, cable car cabins, and station infrastructure.

## Conclusions
Thanks to this project, I have developed several design skills using AutoCAD 2023, skills that will be useful to me in the future. I have improved my ability to visualize objects both in plan and in space, changing my perspective.

Additionally, I have learned about the operating system of cable cars, objects that are significant to me, as well as the components they consist of, and the materials used.
I am glad I had the opportunity to explore this application and work on a complex project under the guidance of my professor.
