## Application

The "Cable Car" project was created using the Autodesk AutoCAD 2023 application. AutoCAD 2023 is a professional computer-aided design (CAD) software developed by Autodesk. It is widely used by architects, engineers, and designers to create precise 2D and 3D drawings.

## Introduction

A cable car is a type of aerial transportation system that moves passengers or cargo using cabins suspended from and propelled by cables. A cable car can operate in different configurations, including systems with one or more cables for support and movement.
Cable cars can be classified into:
- Telegondolas – Continuous-operation systems with multiple cabins, smaller in size, and often used in ski resorts.
- Aerial tramways (Telecabins) – Typically larger cabins that operate on a fixed cable, stopping at stations for boarding and departure.
- Chairlifts – Open-air seating transport, commonly used for ski resorts.

 **Usage:** Cable cars are ideal for overcoming steep slopes and providing efficient transport in mountainous regions or urban areas with difficult terrain.
